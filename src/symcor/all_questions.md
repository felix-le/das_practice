#### **Phần 2: Kiến thức Kỹ thuật Chuyên môn (Technical Knowledge)**

**A. JavaScript & TypeScript**

14. "What are Promises, and how does `async/await` syntax make working with them easier and the code more readable?"
15. "What is a closure in JavaScript? Provide a practical, real-world use case."
16. "What is the difference between an `interface` and a `type` alias in TypeScript? When would you choose one over the other?"

**B. Node.js & Backend**

17. "Explain how the Node.js event loop works and how it enables non-blocking I/O, allowing a single-threaded application to handle high concurrency."
18. "What are Streams in Node.js, and what is the main problem they solve in terms of memory efficiency when dealing with large data?"

21. "How do you manage sensitive information like API keys or database credentials in a Node.js application? What is the role of environment variables?"
22. "What is the difference between `CommonJS` (`require`/`module.exports`) and `ES Modules` (`import`/`export`) in JavaScript and Node.js?"

**C. React**

23. "What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook, and why is its dependency array critical for preventing bugs and performance issues?"
24. "How would you optimize a React component that is re-rendering too often? (Mention techniques like `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`)."

**D. Databases & APIs**

25. "What are the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases? Describe a specific scenario from one of your projects that made you choose one over the other."
26. "What are the key principles you follow when designing a RESTful API to ensure it is clean, consistent, and easy to use?"
